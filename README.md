# Discord nitro themes crack
Get discord nitro themes for free!  
**Browser only**, unless you use a modification app to open the console in the discord app

## Better than the other ones
- No betterdiscord or any modification apps required
- Done in browser, one click
- No flashing (all of the other methods I seen does this)
- One click

## How to use it?
1. Go into nitro-themes
2. Select the theme you want (open the file). You can preview themes in discord by doing settings > appearance > preview theme
3. Copy everything in the file
4. In chrome, click on the star icon at the right edge of the url bar (aka make a bookmark)
5. In the dialog box, click `More...`
6. In the url box, delete everything and paste the code you copied from the file
7. Go to your discord tab, and click on your new bookmark

## Notes
- You need to click on the bookmark again if you reopen discord or reload discord
- Reload the tab to get ride of the theme, or to change to a new theme (overlaying them causes lag)
- The code does not change your mode (light/dark) by default! You have to manually change it according to the theme you are using
