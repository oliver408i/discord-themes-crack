# Discord nitro themes crack
Get discord nitro themes for free!  
**Browser only**, unless you use a modification app to open the console in the discord app

## Better than the other ones
- No betterdiscord or any modification apps required
- Done in browser, one click
- No flashing (all of the other methods I seen does this)
- One click
- Contains amoled theme too. Just follow the steps below

## How to use it: Bookmarklet method
This method works without extensions, but is not persistent across reloads. If you can, use the extension method below.  
1. Go into nitro-themes (for offical discord themes) or custom-themes (themes I made)
2. Select the theme you want (open the file). You can preview themes in discord by doing settings > appearance > preview theme
3. Copy everything in the file
4. In chrome, click on the star icon at the right edge of the url bar (aka make a bookmark)
5. In the dialog box, click `More...`
6. In the url box, delete everything and paste the code you copied from the file
7. Go to your discord tab, and click on your new bookmark

## How to use it: Chrome extension method
This method is a best if you can install your own chrome extensions.  
1. Do steps 1-3 in the Bookmarklet method
2. Download the the repo and put the `chrome-extension` folder somewhere safe
3. Open the `chrome-extension` folder and open `content-script.js`
4. Paste the theme code you copied earlier in there
5. [Optional] Remove the `javascript:` at the beginning of the code
6. Open `chrome://extensions`
7. Drag the `chrome-extension` folder into the tab
8. Done! Reload your discord tab, and make sure you don't delete the `chrome-extension` folder

## Notes
- You need to click on the bookmark again if you reopen discord or reload discord
- The code does not change your mode (light/dark) by default! You have to manually change it according to the theme you are using
- If you are worried that this a virus, don't worry! All source code is provided, just use a [javascript beautifier](https://beautifier.io/) to un-minify it. If you are still uncertain, please see [the explaination](explain.md).
- There are some random not colored parts

## About all-in-one.js !IMPORTANT!
The all-in-one.js is a special hack that makes your discord client think that you have nitro.   
It is only client-side, while means that **you cannot access all nitro features, only a few**.   
The few that works are custom themes and high streaming quality. Nothing else works, even though it seems like it does.   
Although the original hack cannot be seen by discord, this one can be. I haven't heard of anyone's account getting terminated because of this, but I would advise you to take caution while using this hack. With that said, **it is safer and easier to use the original hack.**
